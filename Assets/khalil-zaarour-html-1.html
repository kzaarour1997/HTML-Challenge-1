        <h1>  Mountain Gorilla  </h1>
        <img src="/home/khalil/Downloads/download.jpeg" alt="mountain-gorilla">
    <p>
    
        The <b>Mountain Gorilla</b>lives on the slopes of volcanoes in Rwanda, Zaire and Uganda. 
        They live in small groups led by a dominant male. 
        They are too big and heavy to climb trees and so they wander slowly through the forest eating fruits, leaves and berries. 
        They are the largest of the great apes and look very dangerous, <br>but scientists say they are gentle, intelligent and very friendly.</p>
    
        <h2>The Forest Elephant</h2>
        <img src="/home/khalil/Downloads/forest_ele_medium_Paul_Godard.jpg" alt="forest-elephant">
        <p><b>The Forest Elephant</b>lives in the Congo basin. 
        It is much smaller than the African elephant, which is the biggest animal on Earth.
         Nevertheless, even this <q>small</q> elephant can be up to 250 cm tall. 
         Its ivory is thinner, short and a bit yellowish.</p> 
    
         <h3>  Cimpanzees   </h3>
         <img src="/home/khalil/Downloads/Medium_WW215321.jpg" alt="Chimpanzees" width= "500" height="200">
    
         <br>The African forest is also a home to different kinds of chimpanzees and baboons.
         <br>Most chimpanzees use twigs to get tasty food from difficult places. 
         Some can open nuts with stones and branches. <br>Groups of about twenty chimpanzees travel together looking for fruit and leaves to eat. 
         At night they rest in tall trees on branches.
